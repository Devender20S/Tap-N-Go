# Tap-N-Go
This project is an IoT-based Smart Attendance System designed to automate attendance tracking using RFID technology and an ESP32 microcontroller. It leverages the MQTT protocol for efficient real-time data communication between the hardware and server.
Key Features:

🪪 RFID-based identification for secure and contactless attendance marking

📡 ESP32 microcontroller for edge processing and IoT connectivity

🔄 MQTT protocol for lightweight, real-time data transfer between devices and the server

🐍 Python-based backend for data handling, logging, and visualization

💾 Integration with databases or cloud platforms for attendance storage and analysis
